Also the background is going to change color and it's going to be very obvious. I mean how could you not notice? it's so obviuos. Just like that typo. Unless you're colorblind or dyslexic or something in that case I'm so so sorry. So how was your day? Good? I mean I can't actually hear you, I'm simply a message that was written by it's programmer. That's not to say this programmer doesn't care about what went on in your day though. I hope it was a good one!");
